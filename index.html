<p></p>SlyContacts is your ultimate personal assistant when it comes to organizing and differentiating your contacts.  Over time your phonebook can get pretty crowded, and it can be very difficult to keep track of all the people that you've added, particularly if the contact entry is missing a last name or some other distinguishing note.  SlyContacts solves this problem by providing you with a variety of tools to help keep all your contacts straight.</p>

<p>SlyContacts will organize all your contacts by chronological order so you can see exactly when you added them to your phone.  When you save new contacts to your phone with this app, SlyContacts will use the FaceTime camera to save several behind the scenes  photos of a person as they enter their information into your phone.  Finally, SlyContacts will soon be adding GPS capability so that you can also know exactly where you were when a new contact was added.</p>  

<p>The next time you meet someone new, whether it's at a networking event, a coffee shop, or out on the town, let SlyContacts take care of the rest and you will never lose track of out contacts again.</p>
