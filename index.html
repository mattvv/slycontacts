<p>You meet new people everyday.  And often times exchange contact information.  And you have a phone book overflowing with contacts with the same first name, making it impossible to figure out which Suzy or Mary you mean to reach out to.</p>

<p></p>SlyContacts to the rescue.  Our contact application mimics the native iOS experience and makes it useful and fun.  Don't remember which Suzy in your phonebook is the one you met Friday night?  Have a few too many and not remember that you met Mary that night?  SlyContacts lets you organize your contacts in chronological order to see who you've recently added and improve your ability to match a contact to a face.</p>

<p>But there's more.  When entering that new potential flames info into SlyContacts, we provide the way to "Slyly" snap a picture of Suzy's face and attach it to the contact as your entering standard info.  Is Mary entering her number into your phone herself?  SlyContacts appears to be identical to the native contacts application, but will automatically use the front-facing camera while she's entering those digits to capture that (hopefully) pretty face.  No more trouble putting faces to names to numbers!</p>
